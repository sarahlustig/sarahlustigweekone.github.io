    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h5>Hello, my name is Sarah Lustig. I am a computer science major at the University of Rhode Island.
    <br> I am excited to learn and create throughout the CSC106 course. My hobbies include spending time with 
    <br>friends, playing soccer, and traveling. I started the course with little experience in coding but I hope to
    <br>sharpen my skills and eventually become an expert!
